# ChatBot_Assignment_Part2_ST10446545

This is a text-based chatbot created in C# designed to assist users in learning cybersecurity concepts through an engaging and interactive approach. My project emphasizes improving the flow of conversation, variety of responses, and personalized interactions.

# What’s New in Part 2?
During this stage, the chatbot has received considerable enhancements to make it seem more lively and human-like. It now offers support for:

•	Keyword Recognition
The bot identifies particular cybersecurity subjects such as passwords, phishing, and privacy, among others — offering useful, customized recommendations for each.

•	Sentiment Detection
It is now capable of identifying emotional signals such as worry, confusion, or frustration and reacting with empathy prior to offering advice related to the topic.

Example: “I’m really worried about scams” triggers an encouraging message and helpful scam tips.

•	Memory & Recall
The chatbot retains knowledge of your preferred topic and can provide additional details if you request more information later.

•	Conversational Flow
You can pose additional questions such as “tell me more” or “what else?” and the chatbot will carry on the conversation without revisiting the original topic.
